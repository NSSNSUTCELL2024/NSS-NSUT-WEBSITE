                Reflecting on my time with NSS, I can genuinely say it was the
                highlight of my college experience. NSS was the only society I
                was part of, and it became my second home. The volunteers
                transformed into my extended family, and together we created
                some of my best college memories. From the days of NIC and
                adventure camps to organizing events in villages and spending
                nights camping and cooking together, every moment was filled
                with learning, laughter, and growth. Managing such a dynamic and
                growing team often felt like a significant pressure, but it was
                a challenge that taught me resilience, leadership, and the
                importance of teamwork. As I look back, I am filled with
                gratitude for the opportunities and the incredible people I met
                along the way. The future holds immense potential, and each of
                us has the power to make a significant impact. NSS became my
                platform for change, growth, and unforgettable memories. To all
                my juniors, Embrace every opportunity with enthusiasm and
                dedication. Work hard, but also take time to enjoy the little
                moments and create lasting friendships. Believe in yourself,
                stay motivated, and make the most of every chance to learn and
                grow.

                My journey with the National Service Scheme (NSS) at college has
                been an enriching experience, offering me a chance to engage in
                a diverse range of community service activities. It all began
                with on-ground work at the National Integration Camp (NIC)
                during the summers when college is mostly deserted during the
                holidays. As a modest volunteer, I created lasting memories,
                developed friendships with volunteers from across India, and
                experienced sleepless nights filled with hard work and
                camaraderie. Post NIC, I was entrusted with the role of
                Administrative Coordinator, which allowed me to organize
                impactful events such as the "Run for Unity" in collaboration
                with the DM office. Late-night work at the Student Activity
                Centre and enduring the chilling winters, complete with
                bonfires, during a special camp at the University Adopted
                Village on Delhi's outskirts were unforgettable. Through NSS, I
                made diverse friends from various cultures and learned
                invaluable lessons in leadership and teamwork. In my final year,
                I had the privilege of leading the design team for NSS’s Azad
                magazine, a fulfilling creative endeavor. I wish the NSS unit
                continued success and hope it reaches new heights, setting even
                higher benchmarks in community service.

                Dear Team, It warms my heart to receive such a thoughtful
                message from you all. My journey with NSS has indeed been a
                wonderful experience filled with so much growth, learning, and
                unforgettable moments. It fills me with immense pride to see the
                enthusiasm and dedication within our unit, and I am grateful for
                the opportunity to have been a part of this incredible journey.
                Reflecting on my time with NSS, I remember the hours spent in
                service to our communities, the camaraderie shared during events
                and camps, and the invaluable lessons learned through teamwork
                and collaboration. Yes, there were challenges along the way–
                conflicting ideas, moments of uncertainty, and obstacles to
                overcome. But it's in those moments that the true essence of
                teamwork shines brightest. Understanding each other, respecting
                diverse perspectives, and making decisions in the best interest
                of everyone and the community have been the keys to success. The
                best part lies in the bonds forged with mentors, seniors, and
                the vibrant NSS family. Meeting diverse communities has expanded
                my horizons in ways I couldn't imagine. To all the current and
                future torchbearers of NSS, you're about to embark on an
                incredible journey. Stay committed, stay passionate, and
                remember, every small act of service creates a ripple of
                positive change. You have the power to make a difference. Keep
                shining bright! ✨ Warm regards, Hemant Kumar Rohilla

                Dear NSS Family, Ab jo bhi idhar likh raha hun vo kaafi toh nahi
                lagega but koshish zaroor kari hai maine Saying goodbye isn't
                easy, especially when I look back on the two amazing years we've
                had together. From the time I joined NSS in January 2022 until
                now, it's been a rollercoaster of learning, fun, and friendship
                that I'll cherish forever. Before I started college, my father
                told me that these four years would be the most memorable of my
                life because, regardless of your job path, you should cherish
                your time in college while there is a lot of pressure to make
                sense of your life and you still decide to have fun. When I
                joined NSS in 2022, fresh into my second year of BTech, I was
                eager to dive headfirst into college life after the tumultuous
                period of online classes. The promise of offline classes and the
                opportunity to explore beyond the confines of textbooks, NSS
                seemed like the perfect place to dive into something new. Our
                first outing to Red Fort was exciting, but I was a bit shy at
                first. In the beginning, I was hesitant, unsure of how I would
                fit into this vibrant community. However, fate had its own
                plans. It was during the National Integration Camp in May 2022
                that I truly found my place. In a week-long journey of
                self-discovery, I emerged with newfound confidence and lifelong
                friendships. As I say goodbye to NSS, I want to express my
                deepest gratitude to each and every member of this incredible
                family. To my mentors, fellow volunteers, and friends, thank you
                for being the guiding lights, the pillars of support, and the
                source of endless inspiration. So, as we embark on new
                adventures and embrace the future with open arms, let us carry
                forward the spirit of NSS - of service, unity, and compassion.
                Our journey together may be ending, but the bonds we've forged
                will remain unbreakable. Ek sher NSS k naam, जिंदगी की उस किताब
                में, कॉलेज के चैप्टर की बात ही कुछ ख़ास होगी, जब भी याद करेंगे
                वो हर एक पल , चेहरे पे एक छोटी सी मुस्कुराहट होगी!! For juniors,
                "मंजिल मिले न मिले ये तो मुकद्दर की बात है, हम कोशिश भी न करे ये
                तो गलत बात है।" With love, laughter, and a heart full of
                memories, Ek aakhri baar - Toodles Signing off, Chirag Jain EE,

                Starting my NSUT journey during the COVID era meant my college
                life began on laptop screens, far from the vibrant campus I had
                dreamed of. NSS completely transformed my experience. From
                participating in the Youth Parliament to attending memorable
                events like the Dalhousie adventure camp, NSS helped me break
                out of my shell and forge lasting friendships. As a shy
                second-year student, these moments were invaluable. NSS not only
                provided unforgettable experiences but also played a crucial
                role in my personal development, particularly in honing my
                graphic design skills. Becoming the Graphic Design Head was a
                proud achievement for me. I’m deeply thankful to NSS for its
                incredible impact on my life. A special shoutout to Anuj Sir and
                all my amazing friends who made this journey so remarkable.

                As I stand at the end of my NSUT journey, my heart swells with
                gratitude and nostalgia. These years with NSS NSUT Cell have
                been a such a delight, full of memories, woven with threads of
                service, friendship, and growth. I witnessed the raw beauty of
                humanity—the struggles, the resilience, and the shared dreams.
                NSS wasn't just an organization; it was a family. We laughed
                together, cried together, and celebrated victories together. It
                became more than a platform; it became a part of my soul.
                Remember the National Integration Camp? The friendships, the
                crazy days and late-night conversations—those frolic moments are
                etched in my heart. And the Special Camp? From teaching kids to
                planting trees, we left footprints of kindness. Trip to
                Dalhousie and Amritsar were so much fun!!! Those were the best
                moments of my college life... NSS taught me that unity is our
                greatest strength. When we come together, we can move mountains.
                As I bid farewell, I carry with me not just memories, but a
                sense of purpose. To the new volunteers: Don't replicate what we
                did; innovate! Build upon our legacy, create fresh content, and
                keep the NSS flame burning brightly. Thank you, NSS, for shaping
                me into a compassionate and responsible individual. You'll
                forever hold a special place in my heart. With love and
                gratitude, Signing Off Arshdeep Singh

                I joined NSS in the year 2020. I remember that I was given the
                work to escort the Chief Guests and guide the teachers in the
                inauguration of APJ Theatre Complex. Sounds easy! right? That’s
                what I thought, so I decided that I should continue as a
                volunteer but this was just the beginning. I still remember that
                most of the time I used to be busy driving from one place to
                another to buy different items required for the events or write
                reports for events. The activities carried out in the adopted
                villages gave me a great deal of fulfillment because I was able
                to have an impact on the lives of many people directly. NSS also
                organized trips for all the volunteers.. I remember walking for
                almost 20 km in Dalhousie to get back to the camp. During the
                Delhi, to Amritsar exposure visit we woke up at 4 am to visit
                Golden Temple. When I first saw the temple, it was breathtaking,
                but then I had to wait in line for three hours, which was
                excruciatingly painful, but it did teach me how to patient. I
                wish the fresh team of committed volunteers the best of luck and
                hope that they will continue to elevate NSS to greater heights

                It's been a bittersweet journey, but hey! that's what adventures
                are all about. I realize that the epicentre of my life in
                university has been NSS. Starting college during Covid, seeing
                everything go virtual, my first offline NSS orientation in the
                sports complex is my earliest memory of meeting the people with
                whom I sailed through this voyage over four years. Taking
                initiative, working as a team, and leading from the front to
                achieve the greater good for those around me and the community
                has been my only motivation and compass, helping me explore my
                capabilities to make a difference. From coordinating
                national-level events to staying in villages, every event
                brought an opportunity to learn. Going to adventure camps,
                participating in NYF, and staying through the night in SAC
                planning for events, the journey was rewarding. This was a
                fun-filled journey that nurtured better bonds with every
                volunteer I worked with. To the juniors, always remember that
                the first person you must take initiative for is yourself. Learn
                to choose what’s best for you and what’s not. Making difficult
                decisions promptly is something you need to master as you
                navigate college. A person who is responsible and accountable
                for themselves can then take responsibility for others. My best
                wishes to juniors, I hope you do best, 'cause you always do.
                Keep the legacy of NSS NSUT alive. Finally, cheers to the
                seniors, juniors, and colleagues I met here, who turned out
                either the best friends, mentors or the biggest life lessons. As
                the new chapter starts here, hope to see you all again on the
                other side. Thank you all. Signing off. Chhaviyush

                My NSS journey began by simply acting as a volunteer in the
                inauguration of the APJ complexes. Who knew down the road, I
                would be involved in activities ranging from making reports to
                managing cultural nights during NIC. I will forever remember the
                sleepless nights during various events. Having no experience in
                graphic designing to making the final edits for the magazine,
                NSS helped me unlock a hidden talent. The late-night ice cream
                heists during NIC will be cherished by me forever. Numerous
                plantation, Plogging, and survey drives were conducted in the
                villages and watching the villagers appreciate our efforts made
                it all worthwhile. The thrill of a 20 km long trek to reach back
                to our hostel in Dalhousie and the bumpy yet exciting bus rides
                from Delhi to Amritsar during the exposure visit are some of the
                most memorable moments I had during my time as an NSS volunteer.
                Finally, there are no words to adequately express the joy of
                passing the baton to the next group of dedicated volunteers.

                Dear Homies, As I sit down to reflect on my journey with NSS, a
                flood of memories come rushing in my mind. From the exhilarating
                highs to the challenging lows, each moment has played a
                significant role in shaping who I am today. When I first joined
                NSS, I was filled with a mix of excitement and apprehension.
                Little did I know that this organization would become much more
                than just a scheme – it would become a second home, filled with
                some of the most incredible individuals I've ever had the
                pleasure of knowing. Of course, it hasn't always been smooth
                sailing. We've faced our fair share of challenges along the way
                – from tight deadlines and resource constraints during the time
                of NIC, the survival in chilling nights of Nanakheri village to
                disagreements and setbacks. But through it all, we persevered.
                We rallied together, tackled each obstacle head-on, and emerged
                stronger than ever before. Amidst the challenges, there were
                moments of pure joy and camaraderie. Late-night brainstorming
                sessions fueled by endless cups of coffee, laughter echoing
                through the halls of SAC during the times of NIC , can't forget
                the fight over ice cream at 3 am, that long campus walks through
                out the night, night stays at hostel and endless moments spent
                together as we worked on projects together, and the sense of
                accomplishment when we saw our hard work come to fruition –
                these are the moments I'll treasure forever. But perhaps the
                most rewarding aspect of my time with NSS has been the
                friendships I've made along the way. From the mentors who guided
                me with wisdom and patience to the fellow members who became
                like family, each person has left an indelible mark on my heart.
                One more thing to cherish is the opportunities that I received
                from NSS like visit to Dalhousie; my 1st college trip, and after
                that there was no count to trips, Amritsar, camp in village and
                most important thing to highlight is the opportunity to attend
                National Youth Festival 2024 in Nashik. As I prepare to embark
                on the next chapter of my journey, I carry with me the lessons
                learned and the memories shared during my time with NSS. Though
                our paths may diverge, the bonds we've formed will always
                remain. Thank you NSS, from the bottom of my heart, for being a
                part of this incredible graduation journey. I am grateful for
                each and every one of you, and I look forward to stay connected
                as we continue to pursue our passions and make a difference in
                the world. With heartfelt gratitude, Signing off ' KATYAYANI

                While goodbyes bring a touch of sadness, the bonds forged
                through shared service will forever hold a special place in my
                heart. NSS has always been one of an important part of my
                college life. Being the only ones from our branch to join, it
                never felt so special to embrace this beautiful journey. We
                didn't even realize when, while completing our working hours, we
                kept collecting memories and experiences. NSS not only provided
                us with free visits, trips, and refreshments, but also taught us
                a lot of things. Although I was not able to attend my special
                camp with my senior batch, I still had just as much fun with the
                juniors. The timely reporting, the daily tasks, cracking of
                jokes, and helping in preparations all contributed to building
                bonds with everyone and provided a lot of exposure. NSS has
                become more than just a society for me; it's an emotion. It's
                been a constant source of help and guidance whenever I've
                encountered difficulties, always providing solutions for my
                last-minute needs, for which I am truly grateful. There will
                forever be a space reserved to reflect on the laughter shared,
                the friendships formed, and the adventures embarked upon. While
                this chapter may be closing, the reflections created will remain
                engraved in my heart forever. Here's to the countless moments of
                joy, camaraderie, and growth that we've experienced. Thank you,
                NSS family, for the memories we made together.

                My journey with NSS has been exciting and filled with
                opportunities and joy. NSS has instilled confidence in me to
                make decisions and initiatives. I learnt a lot from seniors and
                applied my knowledge to further develop initiatives like Project
                Aasha. The skills of social engagement are still beneficial for
                me in my daily life while making professional relationships and
                meeting new people. I am grateful to NSS for providing me the
                experience of lifetime(Adventure Camp too) and wish the success
                of NSS NSUT CELL in the forthcoming years. ✨

                Dear NSS team Members,🫶🏼 As I prepare to move on from college,
                I wanted to take a moment to say goodbye and thank you all.
